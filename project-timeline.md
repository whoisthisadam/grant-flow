## Key Milestones

1. **End of Week 3**: Basic infrastructure complete, authentication working
2. **End of Week 7**: Core functionality for both regular users and admins implemented
3. **End of Week 10**: All features including internationalization and reporting complete
4. **End of Week 12**: Fully tested, documented, and deployable system

## Resource Allocation

- **Backend Developers**: Focus on server-side implementation, database, and business logic
- **Frontend Developers**: Focus on JavaFX client, UI components, and internationalization
- **QA Engineers**: Begin testing from Week 8, full-time in Weeks 11-12
- **DevOps**: Support throughout, focus on deployment in Week 12

## Risk Management

1. **Database Integration**: Early focus on Hibernate configuration and testing
2. **Client-Server Communication**: Regular integration testing throughout development
3. **Internationalization**: Implement early to avoid retrofitting issues
4. **Performance**: Conduct performance testing with realistic data volumes in Week 11
